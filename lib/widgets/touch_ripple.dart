/// ### Introduction
/// This widget, inspired by Google Material's ripple effect, visualizes
/// various gestures such as tap(and async), double tap, and long press through
/// ripple effects.
/// 
/// please refer to [GitHub](https://github.com/MTtankkeo/flutter_touch_ripple)
/// when you want to know more about it.
/// 
/// ### How to apply ripple effect?
/// ```dart
/// TouchRipple(
///   // Called when the user taps or clicks.
///   onTap: () => print("Hello, World!"),
///   child: ... // <- this your widget
/// ),
/// ```
